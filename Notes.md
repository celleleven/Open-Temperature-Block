Open Heat Block

1. Wired two thermistors in a voltage divider configuration using a 10kÎ©
2. Wired BTS7960 High Power Motor Driver to Arduino and power supply.
- *NOTE* TEC has a 5 AMP max.
- [ ] Need high power wire, the current wire is only rated for .98 AMPs.
3. Using Kapton tape attached thermistor one to heat block.
4. Code thermistor reading function.
5. Code BTS7960 High Power Motor Driver Function.
- Map() // Voltage (0 to 12) to PWM (0-255)
6. Merge thermistor code with BTS7960 code.
